Cracking the coding interview and other interesting things


  recoding algorithms libraries imitating some of the API Java standard libraries, including data structures, string
manipulation (StringBuilder), FIG (directed graph). Realization of the process are basically using my own implemented
data structures. Some algorithms and additional tools from the "Cracking the coding interview" and "Jianzhi offer" in
the exercises.
